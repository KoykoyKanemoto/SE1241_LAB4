When scaling a database to handle millions of users and books, 
challenges like slow queries and storage issues can arise. 
As data grows, queries may take longer to run. 
Indexing helps speed up searches making it quick to access important information. 
Another challenge is running out of storage space. 
Database partitioning solves this by breaking large tables into smaller,
manageable sections, so it is easier to store and access data efficiently.
